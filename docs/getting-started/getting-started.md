# Getting Started

## Before you begin

### Software requirements
- Eclipse IDE. Minimum Eclipse IDE version: 2022-03. Tested with Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers packages.
- Java runtime. Eclipse interaction with the plugin was tested using versions: 11 and 17.

  WARNING: When using Java 17 to run your applications using using Liberty dev mode, you may encounter problems. The Liberty Maven and Gradle plugins currently do not support java 17.

- [Liberty Tools feature](../installation/installation.md).

### Application requirements

- Define a Liberty server.xml configuration file at location src/main/liberty/config.
- Configure the [Liberty Maven Plugin](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven#configuration) or [Liberty Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle#adding-the-plugin-to-the-build-script)

## Opening the Liberty tools dashboard view

Click on the Open Liberty icon on the toolbar.

Alternatively, click on the `Open Dashboard` option in the `Liberty` menu.

If the dashboard is opened and there are application projects that already properly configured to run on Liberty and use Liberty dev mode, those projects are automatically added to the dashboard when it opens.

If you add new projects or make changes, and you need the dashboard to be refreshed, use the refresh icon in the dashboard toolbar.

The Liberty tools dashboard provides a context menu to the projects in it. Users can choose the menu contents to perform a series of operations aiming to speed up application development.

## Running your application on Liberty using dev mode

There are 3 ways to start your application in dev mode by using the dashboard menu actions associated with each of your application projects.

### Start

If you want to start your application project in dev mode, right click on the project name listed in the dashboard, and click on the `Start` action. A new terminal tab will open to run the application in dev mode.

### Start with parameters

If you want to start your application project in dev mode with custom parameters such as -DhotTests=true, right click on the project name listed in the dashboard, and click on the  `Start...` action. 

A popup view will appear prompting you for custom parameters. Add the needed parameters and click `OK`.

For a full list of supported parameters, check out the [Liberty Maven dev goal parameters](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/dev.md#additional-parameters) or the [Liberty Gradle dev task parameters](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/main/docs/libertyDev.md#command-line-parameters).

### Start in container

If you want to make use of dev mode for containers, right click on the project name listed in the dashboard, and click on the `Start in container` action.

For more information on dev mode for containers, check out the [Liberty Maven devc goal](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/dev.md#devc-container-mode) or the [Liberty Gradle libertyDevc task](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/main/docs/libertyDev.md#libertydevc-task-container-mode).

## Running your application's tests

Once you are [running your application on Liberty using dev mode](#running-your-application-on-liberty-using-dev-mode), you can easily run the tests provided by your application. 

To do this, go to the Liberty tools dashboard, right click on the listed application project name, and select the `Run tests` action. The tests are run in the corresponding terminal.
