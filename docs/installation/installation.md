### Avoid trouble

The plugin uses the available Java, Maven, Gradle, and Docker executables to run the command actions associated with each project on the dashboard. More precisely, the plugin detects what Java executable to use by first checking the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. If that variable is not set, the JRE used to run the Eclipse IDE itself is used. Similarly, the plugin detects what Maven/Gradle executable to use by checking the Maven and Gradle executables defined on the PATH environment variable; however, if the project defines a Maven/Gradle wrapper, the wrapper is used to run the command actions instead. Last, the plugin detects what Docker executable to use by checking the Docker executable defined on the PATH environment variable.

Consequently, to fully setup your environment, be sure to check that your local PATH environment variable contains the paths to the Java, Maven, Gradle, and Docker executables. Be sure that the PATH is also visible to the terminal in your Eclipse IDE.
